# Roadmap Automation

The roadmap for Conduit is communicated via a [GitHub Project]() and uses [Milestones]() to organize each release cycle. The Conduit core team automates as many of the processes as possible so that the roadmap is always a reflection of current state.

## Principles & Workflow Rules

* Any issue in the repo that gets tagged with `roadmap` is a must have for that milestone.
* Releases should have a consistent cadence
* A roadmap issue that doesn't make it into a release will get moved to the next release.
* When a release does happen, communciate what made it into the release and what got moved in the repo's Discussions section
* Sometimes bugs and keep the lights on work needs to happen during a release and that's not necessarily roadmap work.
* When a non-roadmap item does get delivered in a release, add that issue to the roadmap project
* If an issue has its `roadmap` label removed will be removed from the roadmap

## Actions

A handful of actions and workflows power all of the principles that the core team abides by for roadmap development. For more information on what each action does, check out each action's readme:

* [Remove Issue From Project]()
* [Move Incomplete Issues From Milestone]()

## Using Conduit Product Automation

⚠️a **WARNING** ⚠️  If you'd like to use Conduit Product Automation for your own project, it's recommended that you fork the repository into your own organization. The Conduit team can't guarantee that the automation will remain as-is. We're going to continue to develop this to meet the needs of our own organization and product.
